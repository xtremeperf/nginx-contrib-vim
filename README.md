# nginx-contrib-vim

Vim plugin to add detection, indent rules and syntax highlighting support for nginx.conf files.

Install with Pathogen plugin-manager:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xtremeperf/nginx-contrib-vim
```


These files are copied straight from the upstream nginx/nginx repo:
https://github.com/nginx/nginx/tree/master/contrib/vim

Just like this:
```bash
    cp -a nginx/contrib/vim/* nginx-contrib-vim/
```
